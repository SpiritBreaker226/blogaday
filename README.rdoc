Blog a Day is a challenge to blog once a day for 30 days, since it is said that if you do something for 30 days you will make it into a habit. By blogging once a day, you will get those creative juices going and challenge yourself into thinking in new a creative ways.
In order to avoid having small nonsense postings you must enter a minimum of 250 characters that is roughly a paragraph. This web application will send you an email once a day reminding you to blog, which hopefully you will.
